/*** dhis 16/4/2018 ***/

As part of moving the static wifi-splash page into gitlab, the https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/digital-development.git repo containing the original sass has been merged into
this SASS-repo folder (removed Otherworlds Sass and tidied up grunt file + switched to grunt-sass).

npm install (if newly checked out)
grunt watch (the compiled wifi-splash-page.css goes directly into the parent folders' /css)
